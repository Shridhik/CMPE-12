Q: What Did you learn?

	I learned how to operate with logic gates. Learning how to run windows programs on the mac was also a really cool feature that really surprised me! I’ve created A number guessing game in multiple languages including Python, Java, and C, however I’ve never made a game with interaction like this.

Q: What was surprising?

	I've never worked with actual wires, so this was a pretty cool simulation. I found the fact that you could change the properties of most tools very surprising. I also found debugging this very surprising. Many of my issues were with incorrect wiring although I had the right tools out to make my circuit work.

Q: What worked well and What did not?
	
	I had to draw the circuits on paper before I could draw the circuit, however it really helped. It did not help for me to just work directly on MML to wire the circuit. The Guessing game was also a bit of a challenge since I had to know the truth table for XOR before I could properly make it work. Figuring out how to find certain tools was very difficult. I didn't realize half of the tools we required were found by right clicking and editing properties. 


Q: How would you make your own 7-segment display from Part B if you didn’t have one in MML? 
	Since the purpose of the 7 segment display was to display numbers using lights, I would just use LED lights and switches. If the purpose of 7 segment display is to just keep track and count up to 8, I could keep 8 lights and work out logic gates to turn them on. 


Q: How do you think the random number generator works? 
	I believe in Discrete (CE 16) I learned that random numbers are never really “random”. They are generated through hardware that is just hard to track and impossible for us to determine. The numbers appear random to us, however there is a system behind it.


Q: How can things be really random in a computer when it is made of logic gates, which are supposed to be deterministic?

	Like I said in my previous answer, nothing is really random. There is a system behind the random number generator, however to us (the user) it appears random. After doing some research, on Wikipedia, I realized that a deterministic random bit generator is an exemplary algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of the sequence of random numbers. With data, there is a “pseudo random” sequence that is created and not truly random.
